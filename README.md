# fakeLisp
This is a simple LISP interpreter.\n
This interpreter only has 4 function now,but it will have more later.\n
I will add more function after I graduate from high school.\n
The 4 functions that it has are "add","sub","mul" and "div".\n
This interpreter can't run script now,but you can run some command you input.\n
The grammer of command that can be run by This interpreter like scheme Lisp but it's not lisp,so I call it fakeLisp.\n


I use comma to divide car and cdr not dot.Such as (1,2) and (1,(1,2)).\n
And you only can call function in brakets.For exmple,(add 1 1) and (add 1 (sub 2 3)).\n

## Something I want to do after I graduate:
**1.add some function that can control list.**\n
**2.add "define".**
